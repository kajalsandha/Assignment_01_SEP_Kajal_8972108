# Prepared by:- Kajal (8972108)
# Date:- 10 Feb, 2025
## 1. Summary and Goal
The purpose of this discussion is to learn about the difficulties the pet daycare industry faces when it comes to the onboarding of customers as well as employees. In light of the first results, we intend to strengthen the standards and suggest a methodical strategy to expedite onboarding, boost productivity, and guarantee uniformity among all staff members.
## 2. Assumptions
In order to facilitate a productive conversation, the following presumptions have been made:
2.1 Standardized training materials and automation are absent from the present employee onboarding procedure.
2.2 Because different staff members use different methods, the customer onboarding procedure is uneven.
2.3 The management of customer or employee onboarding is not consolidated in a digital system.
2.4 The annoyance is caused by inefficiencies that result in mistakes and delays when processing new clients and staff.
During the meeting, these presumptions will be confirmed and improved.
## 3. Validations
## 3.A. Validation for assumption 2.1
3.A.1 Verify whether the present employee onboarding procedure is done by hand and does not use automated systems or standardized training materials.
3.A.2 If confirmed, talk about the necessity of implementing uniform materials and automated technologies to expedite onboarding.
3.A.3 Plan: Inquire about the client's present employee training procedure and evaluate the possibility of automating it.
## 3.B Validation for assumption 2.2 
3.B.1 Verify whether the client onboarding procedure varies from employee to employee.
3.B.2 Determine whether the inconsistency causes inefficiency and customer annoyance.
3.B.3 Plan: To guarantee uniformity between all staff, talk about the potential for developing a consistent client onboarding checklist.
## 3.C Validation for assumption 2.3
3.C.1 Check to see whether an electronic system for monitoring and controlling the onboarding of new employees and clients is in place.
3.C.2 Look into the possibilities of putting in place a digital system if one doesn't already exist.
3.C.3 Plan: Find out from the customer what onboarding management solutions are currently being used and whether a centralized system is necessary.
## 3.D Validation for assumption 2.4
3.D.1 Verify whether inefficiencies are the main reason for the delays in the onboarding of customers and employees.
3.D.2 Talk about possible ways to increase productivity and lower process mistakes.
3.D.3 Plan: Examine particular locations where inefficiencies occur in further detail and talk about possible automation fixes.
